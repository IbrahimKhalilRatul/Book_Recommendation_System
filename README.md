# Book_Recommendation_System

This project is a Book Recommendation System that uses content-based filtering to recommend books based on their descriptions, titles, and authors. The system leverages Sentence Transformers to generate embeddings for book descriptions and computes cosine similarity to find similar books. The project is implemented in Python and uses popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and sentence-transformers.

**Introduction:**

This project aims to build a book recommendation system that suggests books to users based on the content of the books they have read or are interested in. The system uses Sentence Transformers to generate embeddings for book descriptions and then computes cosine similarity between these embeddings to find similar books.
The system is designed to be simple yet effective, making it a great starting point for anyone interested in building recommendation systems or working with natural language processing (NLP).


**Features**
1.Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books based on their descriptions, titles, and authors.

2.Sentence Transformers: Uses pre-trained transformer models to generate embeddings for book descriptions.

3.Cosine Similarity: Computes similarity between books using cosine similarity.

4.Customizable Recommendations: Allows users to specify the number of recommendations they want.

5.Easy to Use: The code is well-documented and easy to run.
