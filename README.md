# Book_Recommendation_System

#Introduction:

This project aims to build a book recommendation system that suggests books to users based on the content of the books they have read or are interested in. The system uses Sentence Transformers to generate embeddings for book descriptions and then computes cosine similarity between these embeddings to find similar books.

The system is designed to be simple yet effective, making it a great starting point for anyone interested in building recommendation systems or working with natural language processing (NLP).
